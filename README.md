Information about the Digital Edition (gams.uni-graz.at/wiesinger):
The digital edition of the diaries of the Linz writer Karl Wiesinger provides a unique testimony to its time, literature and local history. Wiesinger's hitherto unpublished records from 1961 to 1973 document his development as a literary and political outsider in Austrian culture and also provide information about daily life marked by the Cold War and the social atmosphere in post-war Linz. The diaries are encoded in the XML-TEI format. The digital edition includes comprehensive information on the authorâ€™s life and work as well as commentaries on central aspects of the diaries. An index of persons, places, institutions and key words encoded in XML-TEI allows for focused research or transversal reading.
